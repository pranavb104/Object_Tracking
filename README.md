# Object_Tracking
Experimenting with the Intel RealSense SR300 & D435 to cluster objects and have real-time tracking (Using PCL Library)

This example uses the latest librealsense and PCL library(8.1).

To compile use CMake to build the code in Visual Studio.

The code is compatible with the latest Intel Depth Cameras (D435, D415, SR300).
This code works best with SR300.
D435, D415 have different input resolutions which need to pre-configured to have satisfying results. 
Look at this link for configuring depth camera feed https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/API-How-To
